{@snippet features/build-select-all-source}

The {@link module:select-all/selectall~SelectAll} feature allows selecting the entire content of the WYSIWYG editor using the <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> keystroke or the toolbar button.

## Demo

Press <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> or use the toolbar button to select the entire content of the editor. Note that when editing an image caption, the selection will only expand to the boundaries of the caption.

## Installation

<info-box info>
	This feature is enabled by default in all builds (loaded by the {@link module:essentials/essentials~Essentials} plugin). The installation instructions are for developers interested in building their own, custom rich text editor.
</info-box>

To add this feature to your editor, install the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-select-all`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-select-all) package:

```
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-select-all
```

Then add the `SelectAll` plugin to your plugin list:

```js
import SelectAll from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-select-all/src/selectall';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		// Load the plugin.
		plugins: [ SelectAll, ... ],

		// Display the "Select all" button in the toolbar.
		toolbar: [ 'selectAll', ... ],
	} )
	.then( ... )
	.catch( ... );
```

## Common API

The {@link module:select-all/selectall~SelectAll} plugin registers the `'selectAll'` UI button component and the `'selectAll'` command implemented by {@link module:select-all/selectallcommand~SelectAllCommand}.

The command can be executed using the {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor#execute `editor.execute()`} method:

```js
// Select the entire content of the editor.
editor.execute( 'selectAll' );
```

<info-box>
	We recommend using the official {@link framework/guides/development-tools#ckeditor-5-inspector CKEditor 5 inspector} for development and debugging. It will give you tons of useful information about the state of the editor such as internal data structures, selection, commands, and many more.
